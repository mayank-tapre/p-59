 <p>Pinaki and Happy - The Bhoot Bandhus is Indian animated television series directed by Ankur Chauhan and premiered on the Nickelodeon Sonic. The series showcases the story of an unusual family of ghosts, who adopted a boy named Pinaki, and raised him as one of their own. The series is produced by Tavrohi Animations. The lyrics for the title track of the series is written by poet and lyricist Gulzar and the music is created by Simaab Sen. It premiered on November 9, 2020.</p>
      <p>In the beautiful town of Modern City somewhere in India, there is a haunted palace named, Vibhooti Mansion. What's not known to the people is that there is a nine year human kid named Pinaki who lives among the ghosts. As a baby, Pinaki was found on the doorstep of the mansion, along with a note that the boy must be protected by the people who live in it.
<br>
          <br>
    The family of ghosts, Col. Suri is the head of the family with his lovely wife, Bubbly Suri, who loves to cook some odd dishes, Happy as a Big Brother to Pinaki and Gappu as a cute-little-talking-dog. The ghost family adopt Pinaki and raise him as one of their own. Time flies, all these years Pinaki has been kept within the safe boundaries of the mansion until one day things take a turn when the protagonist decides to step out to see the outside world and pursue further education in Modern City's famous public school. The family has no choice but to come out of the haunted house for the first time in a decade. Thus begins the spooky adventures of Pinaki and his Ghost family followed by a series of fun and slapstick comedy as they try to fit in the outside world. Interestingly, Pinaki ends up resolving all their conflicts with the humans and balancing all the time keeping his family's hidden identity intact.</p>

    <h1>Characters</h1>
        <img src="banner-home.png"><p>
      Pinaki- He is a nine year old smart, and well-learned kid, who has been brought up by his unusual family of ghosts. Things take a turn when he gets admission in a local school and interacts with humans. Pinaki is also a bit naughty and generally works towards making things go in his favour. He tries his best to balance his life between school and his family of ghosts. He is very attentive in class and scores well at school. He is his teacher's favorite.
        <br>
        <br>
Col. Suri- He is the senior-most ghost of the family. He takes decisions and maintains discipline in the mansion like any Army colonel. However, when it comes to the reputation of the family or ghost community or the safety of one of his own, he can bend the rules and go all out.
        <br>
        <br>
Mrs. Suri / Aunty Suri- She is the wife of Col. Suri. She is very firm and strong in nature, yet too kind towards our protagonist Pinaki. She loves him from her soul. She loves to cook and thinks she is a great cook. She likes to cook some odd dishes that generally taste bad. Everyone is scared of her cooking, as she keeps inventing weird recipes.
        <br>
        <br>
Happy- He is like an elder brother to Pinaki. They both have a very friendly equation. He is the youngest and funniest ghost in the family, almost like Johnny Bravo. He is 14 years old. He is an over the top, dramatic teen. Most of the time his silly mistakes end up escalating the problems. He loves singing and speaks funny one-liners, cracks jokes, and makes everyone laugh.
        <br>
        <br>
Gappu- The pet dog of Col. Suri. Ever since he became a ghost, he realized that he could talk like humans. He is a scientist at heart and loves to invent new Bhootiya (Ghostly) gadgets to help himself and the family.
        <br>
        <br>
Sohail- He is one of Pinaki's classmates and his best friend. He is also scared of things sometimes, but whenever the kids are in trouble or feel like things don't go their way, he starts talking very fast, extremely fast.
        <br>
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
Chintu and Mintu- They are the sidekicks of Shantu. They feed him information that he needs and they also support him. They also execute his devious antics. Mintu is the one who encounters paranormal activity most of the time, but no one believes him, not even his twin brother, Chintu.
